# weather_data_Analysis_1
Weather Data Analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and Power BI Dashboard
🌤️ Weather Data Analysis using Python & Power BI
📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing weather data to understand temperature, humidity, and rainfall patterns over time.
The dataset was cleaned and processed using Python (Pandas & NumPy), and interactive dashboards were built in Power BI for better insights.

🎯 Objectives

To clean and preprocess weather data using Python.

To explore relationships between temperature, humidity, and other weather conditions.

To visualize trends and insights using Power BI dashboards.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data cleaning and preprocessing

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy

Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebook – For executing Python code

CSV Dataset – Weather data with multiple parameters
